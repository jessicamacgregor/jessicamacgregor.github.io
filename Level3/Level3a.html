    <h2>Bathe in the moonlight</h2>

    <p>let yourself fall. learn to observe snakes. plant impossible gardens. let someone dangerous in for tea. become a friend of freedom and uncertainty. look forward to dreaming. cry at the movies. swing as high as you can on a swing at moonlight. maintain different moods. do it now. bathe in the moonlight. imagine you are enchanted. praise yourself. let go of fear. be free. just be free.</p>
