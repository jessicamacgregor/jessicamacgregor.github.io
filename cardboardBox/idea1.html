<h1>Australian Government</h1>
<h2>Data Request</h2>

		<p>My first idea was to repost this text on a public use 'Data Request website' for the Australian Government.<br><br>

		If data is not yet made readily avialable to the public, you can generate a request that is viewable to others detailing the information in which you're requesting.<br><br>

		From this came the idea to generate a website in which anyone could add the barcode or box id number (on the side of the box) to the database to track where each cardboard box is going while not concentrating on the contents inside the box. <br><br>

		The hope would be for people to concentrate less on the contents, and more on the identity of the box travelling across and over the world to different terminals, maybe thinking about the lifetime of the box. <br><br>

		By this information being made digital, many people are able to contribute and then track their boxes together,  while seeing many at the same stations at the same time.
