<h1>Chain Letter</h1>
<h2>Email Chain</h2>

		<p>My second idea is based around the infectious quality of information.
			<br><br>One way to illustrate this is through the use of internet chain mail, to emphasize the idea of why we care so much for what is inside a parcel, rather than the parcel itself.</p>

		<p>
			The fact that what could be inside the email chain mail could be infectious, or an interesting piece of information is besides the point when the recipient makes the connection that this is a chain mail and does not take a second look. </p>

			<p>The idea is even if the email is not opened, because it is simply a chain mail, or a cardboard box, it has to contain something to be something. So the chain mail does not exist unless it is opened.</p>
