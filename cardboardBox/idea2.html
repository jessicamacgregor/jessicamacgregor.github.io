<h1>Chain Letter</h1>
<h2>Email Chain</h2>

<p> The email I have sent out to a variety of email addresses through a site named 'hunter.io' lets you search for email addresses within companies. I have typed in a transport company to mirror the content of the original source material, and blasted a list of people.

	<br><br>
	Problems have arisen in terms of having to verify I am not a computer every email that is sent. They have also limited me in terms of how many emails I can blast out each day, based on them thinking I am a computer.</p>
