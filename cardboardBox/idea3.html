<h1>Instagram Feed</h1>
<h2>A feed of the same cardboard box recording its GPS position.</h2>

<p>My final idea is based on the <i>identity</i> of the cardboard box.
	<br><br>The idea that the cardboard is labelled and tracked throughout its ports, only once it holds one piece of paper.<br><br>

	One way to reflect the objects identity would be to create an instagram feed, checking in at day-to-day places normally tagged by the public to reflect their<i> presence</i> in society. </p>
